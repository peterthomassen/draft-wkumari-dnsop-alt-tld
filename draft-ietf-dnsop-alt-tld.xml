      <t>This document reserves a string (&lt;TBD&gt;) to be used as a TLD
      label in non-DNS contexts, or for names that have no meaning in a global
      context. It also provides advice and guidance to developers developing
      alternate namespaces.</t>

      <t>[ Ed note: This document is called dnsop-alt-tld. The draft has gone
      through 12 revisions with the suggested string being .ALT. The actual
      string used is not important, but it does need to be human readable /
      typable, short, and not give the impression that systems which use it
      are somehow second class citizens. This version has replaced the string
      in the body with &lt;TBD&gt; to make it clear that the string itself is
      not important.]</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Many protocols and systems need to name entities. Names that look
      like DNS names (a series of labels separated with dots) have become
      common, even in systems that are not part of the global DNS administered
      by IANA.</t>

      <t>This document reserves the label "&lt;TBD&gt;" (short for
      "Alternate") as a Special Use Domain (<xref target="RFC6761"/>). This
      label is intended to be used as the final (rightmost) label to signify
      that the name is not rooted in the DNS, and that normal registration and
      lookup rules do not apply.</t>

        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

    </section>

    <section anchor="background" title="Background">
      <t>The DNS data model is based on a tree structure, and has a single
      root. Conventionally, a name immediately beneath the root is called a
      "Top Level Domain" or "TLD". TLDs usually delegate portions of their
      namespace to others, who may then delegate further. The hierarchical,
      distributed and caching nature of the DNS has made it the primary
      resolution system on the Internet.</t>

      <t>The success of the DNS makes it a natural starting point for systems
      that need to name entities in a non-DNS context, or that have no unique
      meaning in a global context. These name resolutions occur in a namespace
      distinct from the DNS.</t>

      <t>In many cases, these systems build a DNS-style tree parallel to, but
      separate from, the global DNS. They often use a pseudo-TLD to cause
      resolution in the alternate namespace, using browser plugins, shims in
      the name resolution process, or simply applications that perform special
      handling of this particular alternate namespace.</t>

      <t>In many cases, the creators of these alternate namespaces have chosen
      a convenient or descriptive string and started using it. These strings
      are not registered anywhere nor are they part of the DNS. However they
      appear to users and to some applications to be TLDs, and issues may
      arise if they are looked up in the DNS.</t>

      <t>An alternate name resolution system might be specifically designed to
      provide confidentiality of the looked up name, and to provide a
      distributed and censorship-resistant namespace. This goal would
      necessarily be defeated if the queries leak into the DNS, because the
      attempt to look up the name would be visible at least to the operators
      of root name servers and to any entity viewing the DNS lookups going to
      the root nameservers.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="The ALT namespace">
      <t>This document reserves the &lt;TBD&gt; label, using the <xref
      target="RFC6761"/> process, for use as a pseudo-TLD. This creates an
      unmanaged sandbox namespace. The &lt;TBD&gt; label MAY be used in any
      domain name as a pseudo-TLD to signify that this is an alternate
      (non-DNS) namespace.</t>

      <t>Alternate namespaces should differentiate themselves from other
      alternate namespaces by choosing a name and using it in the label
      position just before the pseudo-TLD (&lt;TBD&gt;). For example, a group
      wishing to create a namespace for Friends Of Olaf might choose the
      string "foo" and use any set of labels under foo.&lt;TBD&gt;.</t>

      <t>As they are in an alternate namespace, they have no significance in
      the regular DNS context and so should not be looked up in the DNS
      context. Some of these requests will inevitably leak into the DNS
      context (for example, because of clicks on a link in a browser that does
      not have a extension installed that implements the alternate namespace
      resolution), and so the &lt;TBD&gt; TLD has been added to the "Locally
      Served DNS Zones" <xref target="RFC6303">(</xref>) registry to limit how
      far these flow.</t>

      <t>Groups wishing to create new alternate namespaces MAY create their
      alternate namespace under a label that names their namespace under the
      &lt;TBD&gt; label. They SHOULD choose a label that they expect to be
      unique and, ideally, descriptive. There is no IANA controlled registry
      for names under the &lt;TBD&gt; TLD - it is an unmanaged namespace, and
      developers are responsible for dealing with any collisions that may
      occur under .&lt;TBD&gt;. Informal lists of namespaces under
      .&lt;TBD&gt; may appear to assist the developer community.</t>

      <t>[Editor note (to be removed before publication): There was
      significant discussion on an IANA registry for the &lt;TBD&gt; namespace
      - please consult the lists for full thread, but the consensus seems to
      be that it would be better for the IETF / IANA to not administer a
      registry for this. It is expected one or more unofficial lists will be
      created where people can list the strings that they are using. ]</t>

      <t>Currently deployed projects and protocols that are using pseudo-TLDs
      may decide to move under the &lt;TBD&gt; TLD, but this is not a
      requirement. Rather, the &lt;TBD&gt; TLD is being reserved so that
      current and future projects of a similar nature have a designated place
      to create alternate resolution namespaces that will not conflict with
      the regular DNS context.</t>

      <section title="Choice of the string">
        <t>The first 12 versions of this document suggested the use of the
        stirng .ALT. The authors still think that this is a short, clear
        string, clealy expressing that this is an ALTernate resolution
        context, but any clear, consise, human-readable term will work. In
        order for this technique to be effective the names need to continue to
        follow both the DNS format and conventions (a prime consideration for
        alternate name formats is that they can be entered in places that
        normally take DNS context names); this rules out using suffixes that
        do not follow the usual letter, digit, and hyphen label convention.
        The WG will need to select a name, and the authors will replace the
        string &lt;TBD&gt; with the selected name.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>The IANA is requested to add the &lt;TBD&gt; string to the
      "Special-Use Domain Name" registry (<xref target="RFC6761"/>, and
      reference this document. In addition, the "Locally Served DNS Zones"
      (<xref target="RFC6303"/>) registry should be updated to reference this
      document.</t>

      <section title="Domain Name Reservation Considerations">
        <t>This section is to satisfy the requirement in Section 5 of
        RFC6761.</t>

        <t>The domain "&lt;TBD&gt;.", and any names falling within
        ".&lt;TBD&gt;.", are special in the following ways:<list
            style="numbers">
            <t>Human users are expected to know that strings that end in
            .&lt;TBD&gt; behave differently to normal DNS names. Users are
            expected to have applications running on their machines that
            intercept strings of the form &lt;namespace&gt;.&lt;TBD&gt; and
            perform special handing of them. If the user tries to resolve a
            name of the form &lt;namespace&gt;.&lt;TBD&gt; without the
            &lt;namespace&gt; plugin installed, the request will leak into the
            DNS, and receive a negative response.</t>

            <t>Writers of application software that implement a non-DNS
            namespace are expected to intercept names of the form
            &lt;namespace&gt;.&lt;TBD&gt; and perform application specific
            handing with them. Other applications are not intended to perform
            any special handing.</t>

            <t>In general, writers of name resolution APIs and libraries do
            not need to perform special handing of these names. If developers
            of other namespaces implement their namespace through a "shim" or
            library, they will need to intercept and perform their own
            handling.</t>

            <t>Caching DNS servers SHOULD recognize these names as special and
            SHOULD NOT, by default, attempt to look up NS records for them, or
            otherwise query authoritative DNS servers in an attempt to resolve
            these names. Instead, caching DNS servers SHOULD generate
            immediate negative responses for all such queries.</t>

            <t>Authoritative DNS servers SHOULD recognize these names as
            special and SHOULD, by default, generate immediate negative
            responses for all such queries, unless explicitly configured by
            the administrator to give positive answers for private-address
            reverse-mapping names.</t>

            <t>DNS server operators SHOULD be aware that queries for names
            ending in .&lt;TBD&gt; are not DNS names, and were leaked into the
            DNS context (for example, by a missing browser plugin). This
            information may be useful for support or debugging purposes.</t>

            <t>DNS Registries/Registrars MUST NOT grant requests to register
            "&lt;TBD&gt;" names in the normal way to any person or entity.
            These "&lt;TBD&gt;" names are defined by protocol specification to
            be nonexistent, and they fall outside the set of names available
            for allocation by registries/registrars.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>One of the motivations for the creation of the &lt;TBD&gt; pseudo-TLD
      is that unmanaged labels in the managed root name space are subject to
      unexpected takeover if the manager of the root name space decides to
      delegate the unmanaged label. Another motivation to to increase use
      privacy for those users who do use alternate name resolution systems, by
      limiting how far these queries leak if used on a system which does not
      implement the alternate resolution system.</t>

      <t>The unmanaged and "registration not required" nature of labels
      beneath .&lt;TBD&gt; provides the opportunity for an attacker to re-use
      the chosen label and thereby possibly compromise applications dependent
      on the special host name.</t>
